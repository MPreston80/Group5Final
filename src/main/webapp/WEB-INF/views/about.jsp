<h1> About the QLine</h1>

<h3>Facts about the Qline and it's creator </h3><br>

    <p>M-1 RAIL is a non-profit organization formed in 2007 to lead the design, construction, <br>
    and future operation of a 3.3-mile circulating streetcar along Woodward Avenue between <br>
    Congress Street and West Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan. M-1 RAIL is an unprecedented <br>
    public-private partnership and model for regional collaboration Notably, the first major <br>
    transit project being led and funded by both private businesses, philanthropic organizations, <br>
    in partnership with local government, the State of Michigan, and U.S. Department of Transportation.<br>
    <br>

    Mission<br>
    <br>

    The mission of M-1 RAIL is to create a catalyst for investment, economic development and urban renewal <br>
    that positively impacts the entire region through the construction of a streetcar circulator system running <br>
    along and connecting Woodward Avenue from the Riverfront to the New Center and North End neighborhoods.<br>
    <br>

    Vision <br>
    <br>

    The M-1 RAIL Woodward Avenue Streetcar project is envisioned to be one element of a future modern,<br>
    world-class regional transit system where all forms of transportation, including rail, bus, vehicle,<br>
    bicycle and pedestrian, are considered and utilized to build a vibrant, walk-able region that includes <br>
    a thriving Downtown Detroit. This city center is envisioned by supporters of M-1 RAIL to become a <br>
    foundation for growth and prosperity throughout the surrounding neighborhoods adjacent to the Central <br>
    Business District, Midtown, New Center and North End.<br>
    <br>

    Community Engagement <br>
    <br>

    M-1 RAIL values working closely with community groups and residents throughout the project. <br>
    Community Advisory Council members meet monthly to help provide expertise and input to assist <br>
    M-1 RAIL in building the best streetcar line possible. The CAC engages M-1 RAIL in decision <br>
    making around its communications and outreach strategies and provide perspective about accessibility, <br>
    economic development and workforce development that M-1 RAIL will take back to its partners to lead those efforts.<br>

    M-1 is also working closely with the business community to communicate <br>
    construction and engage in planning for the streetcar line. The Business Advisory <br>
    Council meets monthly to help guide and provide feedback on construction, road closures,<br>
    parking mitigation and ongoing development of the streetcar line to ensure all opportunities<br>
    and concerns are addressed as the project gets underway.<br>
